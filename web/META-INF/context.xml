          By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
          to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
          you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary.

          Built-in Tomcat manager roles:
            - manager-gui    - allows access to the HTML GUI and the status pages
            - manager-script - allows access to the HTTP API and the status pages
            - manager-jmx    - allows access to the JMX proxy and the status pages
            - manager-status - allows access to the status pages only

          The users below are wrapped in a comment and are therefore ignored. If you
          wish to configure one or more of these users for use with the manager web
          application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds them. You
          will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
